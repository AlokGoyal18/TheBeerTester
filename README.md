This app covers Knowledge and examples of following concepts.
- The use of Retrofit to extract data from the Punk API.

- I used various Ai based image generation tools for Icons and Logo like Dall.E and LOGO.com
- Use of Corutines and ViewModel Lifecycle manager.

- Share Beer Information with your friend as an image which carries information about the beer.
